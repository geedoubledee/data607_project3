We believe that we are better together, and at TheFork we welcome you for who you are.  Our workplace is for everyone, as is our people powered platform.  At TheFork, we want you to bring us your unique perspective and experiences, so we can collectively keep disrupting the restaurant industry and go from good to great.
 
Context: 
At TheFork, data is everyday more at the core of our decision making processes and our product(s) (data sharing with our customers; machine learning algorithms for personalization, content enhancement, yield management etc), As we continue accelerating in that domain, with further data usage at all levels of the company and to faster capacity to integrate data products in our product development strategies, we want to bring our technical data frameworks, capabilities (data platform; data integration capabilities; data products and machine learning frameworks ) and processes to the next level.
 
TheFork’s data organization is a central organization of ~40 FTEs supporting all business functions (Product, Marketing, Sales, Operations, etc). The data team gathers the complete set of expertises (Data Engineering, Analytics, Data science, Data Product Management, etc) required to provide business teams with end-to-end data support to accelerate their  strategies. The team recently initiated a Data Mesh journey with the creation of first Data Domains, that we want to further equip in terms of self-service data platform and data governance tooling.
 
The Data Platform and the data integration activities are a foundational component of this organization to allow robustness and scalability of its delivery.
 
Overall, the role of the Director of Data Platforms, Data Engineering and data integration we are looking for is to ensure that TheFork has robust, efficient, and effective data solutions allowing us to boost the implementation of data activation use cases.
 
What you will do: 
Managing and mentoring teams of data engineers and data integration specialists to design, develop, deploy, and maintain data systems, data engineering practices, and data integration processes that support our various data activation use cases:
Ensuring that the data platforms and data integration systems are scalable, reliable, and secure
Providing the required enabling frameworks for data products (datasets as products, machine learning algorithms, api(s), data governance tooling,...) development in a context where we are inspired by data mesh principles
Contribute to the evolution of the data engineering strategy for the company:
You will animate discussions on how to scale and distribute further our data engineering activities
You will challenge and revamp the way we move and consolidate data within and between the different applications of the company
Collaborating with cross-functional teams to identify and prioritize data needs, and to develop and implement solutions to meet those needs
Staying up-to-date with the latest developments and trends in data platform and data engineering technologies and best practices.
 
You will be part of the Data Leadership team and will report into the Chief Data Officer. 
You will also play a key role in connecting the dots between the Data team and the different Engineering teams who develop our Products and internal tools.
 
To help you in achieving your goals, you’ll start with a team composed of our Data engineer team (6 data engineers with a manager). Data integration resources (team of Talend experts, currently outside of the data team and which role, scope and skills will be reconsidered with your support) will then be included in your scope with an approach that we expect you to drive. Data Ops and Data architect profiles (part of our engineering organization) will continue to closely collaborate with your teams. You will also have a very close collaboration with our Core BI team which is running our data warehousing and core data modeling activities.
We expect that you design the next steps of this organization: scope, structure, sizing, skills etc.
 
We’ll measure the success of your position through the following outcomes:
Data platform and data integration uptime: The percentage of time that the data platform and data integration systems are available and functioning properly.
Productivity and efficiency of the team
Data platform and data integration performance and scalability: speed and efficiency with which data is transferred and processed and the capacity of the systems  to handle increasing volumes of data without degradation in performance
Adoption and usage of provided technical frameworks and systems to support creation of data products
Satisfaction of the users your team is supporting
