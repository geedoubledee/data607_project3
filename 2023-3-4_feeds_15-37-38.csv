L’électrocardiogramme (ECG) est la technique de référence pour mesurer le rythme cardiaque. A Withings, nous apportons une solution plus confortable avec une mesure du rythme cardiaque au poignet sans intervention de l’utilisateur sur nos montres connectées. Parmi les différentes technologies de mesures du rythme cardiaque existantes, la <strong>photopléthysmographie</strong> (PPG) est la technologie la plus couramment utilisée dans le domaine des appareils électroniques grand public. Bien que cette fonctionnalité soit très répandue chez les constructeurs de montre connectées, l’intégration d’un algorithme d’estimation du rythme cardiaque est un problème complexe tant par la nature des signaux PPG que par les contraintes hardware d’un appareil embarqué. </p><p>Le principal enjeu consiste à atteindre des exigences élevées en termes de précision et de fiabilité de la mesure du rythme cardiaque, pour des activités variées y compris impliquant des mouvements intenses de l’utilisateur. La littérature scientifique présente différentes solutions mais est limitée par le manque de base de données représentatives. Les performances annoncées dans la littérature sont cantonnées à des cas d’usages spécifiques et sont généralement surestimées par rapport à un usage réel et aux attentes de précision des utilisateurs. La principale difficulté dans la mesure du rythme cardiaque continu sur des signaux optiques consiste à atténuer la pollution du signal par le mouvement et à isoler l’information pulsative ([1], [2]). Les solutions de suivi de battement temporel dans le signal optique ne sont pas robustes au mouvement [3]. Les solutions utilisant une <strong>analyse spectrale</strong> <strong>des signaux optiques et d’accélération</strong> sont efficaces pour suivre le rythme cardiaque lors de mouvements spécifiques dont le contenu fréquentiel est distinct de la fréquence cardiaque [2]. Les solutions les plus récentes utilisent souvent le deep learning, qui semble être une méthode prometteuse pour ce problème ([5], [6], [7]). </p><p>Après une étude approfondie des solutions <strong>deep learning</strong> de la littérature, le stagiaire devra identifier les méthodes les plus prometteuses et les plus adaptées au cadre d’application de Withings. Le stagiaire sera inséré sur un travail de recherche interne présentant déjà une solution deep learning appliquée aux données de Withings à améliorer. Une première étape consistera à comprendre la solution déjà existante et d’en analyser ses limites en termes de modèles, de méthodologie et de données. La deuxième étape consistera à tester des solutions d’amélioration et de complexification à partir du modèle actuel  sur des données de Withings. L’objectif de ce stage est d’évaluer le potentiel des solutions deep learning pour nos montres connectées. En cas de performances encourageantes, le stagiaire pourra être amené à embarquer son modèle deep learning via une implémentation en C afin d’être intégré dans le produit pour un test en interne. </p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul> <li>A la recherche d'un stage d'une <strong>durée de 6 mois</strong>, vous avez des connaissances théoriques en traitement du signal, en analyse      spectrale (transformée de fourier) et en méthodes d’apprentissage profond</li> <li>Compétences informatiques : programmation en Python, première      expérience en framework deep learning (Pytorch      ou Tensorflow) appréciée ,      programmation en C est un bonus</li> <li>Intérêt pour les méthodes d’apprentissage profond </li> <li>Intérêt pour les applications en santé connectée</li> <li>Lecture de l’anglais scientifique et technique</li> <li>Capacité rédactionnelle, de rigueur et d’autonomie</li> <li>Aptitude pour le travail en équipe et communication </li> </ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p>Rejoindre l’aventure Withings, c’est :</p><ul> <li>Intégrer un des pionniers et leaders mondiaux de la santé connectée, plusieurs fois primé au Consumer Electronic Show</li> <li>Contribuer à des projets innovants et ambitieux pour la santé de demain dans un environnement agile et en constante évolution</li> <li>Intégrer une entreprise internationale, membre de la FrenchTech 120, dont les équipes sont basées à Issy-les-Moulineaux, Boston, Hong-Kong et Shenzhen</li> <li>Participer à l’amélioration continue de nos produits et services en les bêta-testant avant leur sortie, notamment lors de nos nombreuses sessions sportives entre collègues</li> <li>Participer à la Withings Med Academy en assistant à des conférences de professionnels de santé afin de renforcer ses connaissances dans le domaine médical</li> <li>Collaborer avec des collègues passionnés et célébrer ensemble chacune de nos réussites !</li> </ul><p>Toutes les candidatures reçues sont étudiées indépendamment de l’origine ethnique, des croyances, de la religion, du genre, de l’orientation sexuelle ou de la santé des candidats.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>We are open to hiring junior or senior Data Analyst or Data Scientist, so please apply to this posting even if you believe you may be overqualified.</p>
<p>MoveOn is a diverse and vibrant community of millions of people working together to create progressive change in America. We are an innovative campaigning organization that supports people throughout the country to take action through driving impactful campaigns that influence the behavior of people and institutions, shape the outcomes of elections, and expand the realities of what’s possible. We organize to challenge entrenched power, while pursuing economic, racial, and social justice and a vision of a country in which everyone can thrive.</p>
<p>MoveOn has a particularly important role to play in the Trump era. We are working to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP in 2020 by building a powerful, multiracial, and economic populist movement that will give voters something to vote<em> for</em>, not just against—and we’re also working to defend communities that are on the front lines of Trump and GOP attacks, including immigrants, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and women. In service of that mission, in 2020 and beyond, MoveOn will drive impactful, movement-connected, multichannel, nimble campaigns aimed at impact.</p>
<p>The Data Analyst or Data Scientist will support MoveOn’s core 2020 election programs through the testing and analysis of analytics-based interventions, with the goals of maximizing volunteer engagement, increasing vote-by-mail applications, supporting our peer-to-peer fundraising program, and increasing turnout for Joe Biden and Democrats in the November election.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities may include …</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying, designing, and deploying analytics-based tactics that support MoveOn’s goal of defeating Donald Trump in November.</li>
<li>Conducting statistical analyses to identify best target audiences for various programs.</li>
<li>Evaluating the heterogeneous treatment impacts of alternative messages on subsets of our targeted populations of voters.</li>
<li>Designing and running randomized controlled trials to test innovative interventions to increase volunteer engagement and voter turnout.</li>
<li>Developing visualizations to communicate results and enhance campaign efforts.</li>
<li>Supporting fundraising initiatives to raise money for MoveOn and progressive candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>To be a successful candidate, you will …</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have experience working in data analytics &amp; statistics, specifically with large databases.</li>
<li>Be passionate about using analytics to drive progressive change.</li>
<li>Be clear about what you know and seek help for things you don’t know. We don’t expect you to be an expert in everything, but we do want someone who is willing to ask questions when needed.</li>
<li>Be a good communicator. The analysis work you conduct will help inform programmatic decisions for other teams across MoveOn. Being able to communicate results is critical to maximizing the impact of your work.</li>
<li>Be aware of data limitations. The data that forms the foundation of much of our analysis often has inherent biases that disproportionately impact marginalized or underrepresented populations. Being aware of and mitigating these biases when possible is important to help ensure that we aren’t leaving people out or exacerbating biases when implementing results in our programs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1+ years experience creating statistical models or applying machine learning in classification or predictive applications using statistical programming software like R, Python, Stata, or SAS.</li>
<li>Working with large datasets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Communicating technical results with a nontechnical audience.</li>
<li>Preferred but not required: designing and implementing randomized controlled trials.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Position may be based anywhere in the continental United States. May require occasional travel.</p>

<p>Job title: Analyst</p>
<p>Company: Delta Hat Limited</p>
<p>Location: Long Eaton, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire</p>
<p>Salary: Dependent on qualifications and experience; 25k – 55k GBP</p>
<p>Job type: This is a permanent role. We are looking for candidates that are able to work for a substantial proportion of the working week, though this does not necessarily need to be full time. We have core company hours for which we would expect you to be in the office, with flexibility outside these hours.</p>
<p>Starting date: Negotiable – we would like someone in post as soon as possible but we are prepared to wait for the right candidate</p>
<h1>About Delta Hat</h1>
<p>Delta Hat is a small consultancy based near Nottingham providing industry-leading analysis to the pharmaceutical sector. We focus on the technical aspects of evidence-based medicine and health technology assessment, utilising methods such as cost-effectiveness modelling, propensity scoring, and meta-analysis. For the right candidate we offer a fascinating and well-paid career undertaking research on medicines and producing analyses that can directly influence clinical practice.</p>
<p>At Delta Hat, we provide a high level of senior input to the projects we undertake. This means you would spend the majority of your time working in close contact with senior members of staff. Collectively we have around 50 peer reviewed publications, and have contributed to over assessments of interventions, for a range of health conditions.</p>
<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<p>Your day-to-day work will involve the analysis and modelling of clinical trial data in a combination of the statistical software package R, and Microsoft Excel. This is then communicated to clients via face-to-face meetings, telephone calls and technical reports, with the potential to be published in journals and/or presented at industry conferences. You will be given responsibility from the outset and encouraged to develop a specialism and perform research in line with your interests and skillset.</p>
<h1>The role and requirements</h1>
<p>We are a small team with in-depth experience in statistics, health economics, and evidence-based medicine. We are looking for candidates with a similar depth of experience in programming, to help us improve the programming skillset of the Delta Hat team. Whilst ideally a candidate would have a relevant degree and potentially postgraduate qualification (for example in statistics, computer science, or other analysis based subject) this is not mandatory, and we would be open to a candidate with a demonstrable track record.</p>
<p>The position would involve learning and undertaking some aspects of the industry that we work in (medicine), but also to help us improve what we do by bringing in knowledge from adjacent disciplines. Most importantly Delta Hat is interested in adding a different skillset – implementing complex analyses, and improving the transparency, reproducibility and reducing runtime of our outputs.</p>
<p>The candidate we are looking for will have experience with programming; either formal training, or substantial on the job experience. Ideally this would be in R, SAS or VBA (the tools primarily used in our field), but the data handling skillset is more important than experience with the exact programming languages. An interest in analysing data to answer questions is essential.</p>
<p>Most importantly we are looking for someone who seeks a rewarding career, and has experience working in a project-based environment either within industry or academia. All candidates must have the right to work in the UK, and due to the sensitive nature of the work, are asked to declare any unspent convictions.</p>
<h1>Benefits</h1>
<p>We offer a compelling package for the right candidate. As well as a salary commensurate with the work, we offer generous amounts of annual leave (equating to around 35 days including bank holidays) and excellent equipment. As the company is small, you will have a meaningful say in how it is run, and the type of work we take on. Further to this, a share of company profits is distributed amongst staff annually.</p>
<p>Because of the high level of exposure to a variety of projects we anticipate you would develop quickly, and we will coach and support you to enable this. We are keen to aid your professional development which may involve sending you on courses, attending conferences, or taking a range of different roles on projects. Our staff are our main asset, and we invest in them accordingly.</p>
<p>Whilst the salary range is extremely wide, this is to reflect our openness to candidates at different levels – from a candidate with extensive experience in a highly related field, to a (relatively) recent graduate with limited directly transferrable skills.</p>",https://www.r-users.com/jobs/r-programmer-analyst-nottingham-uk/,https://extract.feedbin.com/parser/feedbin/a2cb97e5ac0dd4dd6c47e594b872717bc6f92693?base64_url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuci11c2Vycy5jb20vam9icy9yLXByb2dyYW1tZXItYW5hbHlzdC1ub3R0aW5naGFtLXVrLw==,2019-11-22T20:12:40.000000Z,2019-11-22T20:26:47.253664Z

<p><strong>Assignment Details</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assignment Title</strong> Population Data Fellow, Vital Statistics Capacity Building (NY) <strong>Organizational Context &amp; Project Description</strong></p>
<p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)</p>
<p>UNFPA is the United Nations Population Fund. Our mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.</p>
<p>UNFPA supports:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reproductive health care for women and youth in more than 150 countries – which are home to more than 80 per cent of the world’s population</li>
<li>The health of pregnant women, especially the 1 million who face life-threatening complications each month</li>
<li>Reliable access to modern contraceptives sufficient to benefit 20 million women a year</li>
<li>Training of thousands of health workers to help ensure at least 90 per cent of all childbirths are supervised by skilled attendants</li>
<li>Prevention of gender-based violence, which affects 1 in 3 women</li>
<li>Abandonment of female genital mutilation, which harms 3 million girls annually</li>
<li>Prevention of teen pregnancies, complications of which are the leading cause of death for girls 15-19 years old</li>
<li>Efforts to end child marriage, which could affect an estimated 70 million girls over the next 5 years</li>
<li>Delivery of safe birth supplies, dignity kits and other life-saving materials to survivors of conflict and natural disaster</li>
<li>Censuses, data collection and analyses, which are essential for development planning</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data Fellows Programme</strong></p>
<p>UNFPA will host its inaugural cohort of Population Data Fellows in its global headquarters (New York) and selected regional and country offices around the world in 2019-2020. Through this programme, Population Data Fellows will come together to design and deliver targeted projects that contribute to the overall population data work of UNFPA.</p>
<p>The inaugural cohort of 2019-2020 Population Data Fellows will contribute to UNFPA’s work on civil registration and vital statistics in the areas of</p>
<p>(1) qualitative population field research,<br>
(2) data analytics of vital registration data, and<br>
(3) capacity building in completeness assessment, demographic data quality assessment and vital statistics analysis.</p>
<div title=""Page 3"">
<div>
<div>
<p>The Fellowship programme will be residential for a period of up to 12-months (possible extension subject to available funding), with Fellows living at a specific UNFPA duty station and working in the associated UNFPA office under the direction of either the Country Office’s UNFPA Representative, the Regional Office’s Population and Development Regional Advisor, or the Population and Development Branch Chief at UNFPA Headquarters.</p>
<p>Qualitative Population Field Research</p>
<p>This program of work at UNFPA seeks to understand the proximate determinants of under-registration of vital events across the life course, including registration of births, marriages, divorces, and deaths. Through qualitative research – primarily through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews – UNFPA is seeking to understand why certain subpopulations are more likely to have their vital events registered than others. Further, this work seeks to understand the social, economic and political consequences for individuals of being invisible to the civil registration system. This work will be closely aligned with large-scale data analysis of civil registration, census and survey data.</p>
<p>Data Analytics of vital event registration data</p>
<p>In order to systematically strengthen CRVS systems, we need to understand how complete they are and the quality of the underlying data. This is important to identity which areas of the system need further improvement, and it is also is needed to make adjustments to civil registration data when producing representative and reliable vital statistics at national and subnational levels. Fellows engaged in this workstream will support analysis and assessment of civil registration data under the guidance of UNFPA technical staff.</p>
<p>Capacity building in completeness assessment, demographic data quality assessment and vital statistics analysis</p>
<p>UNFPA supports National Statistics Offices in low- and middle-income countries via technical capacity building. This workstream involves development of capacity building materials and support to training workshops for National Statistics Offices and Civil Registration authorities in the area of civil registration data assessment, vital statistics production, and vital statistics usage.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Development Goals 17</strong>. Partnerships For the Goals Task description</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of Chief, Population and Development Branch, the UN Volunteer will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn contemporary technical methods of assessing data quality and completeness of civil registration data, adjusting civil registration data to account for coverage and content error, and producing vital statistics from civil registration data;</li>

<p><strong>Conditions of Service and other information</strong></p>
<p>Condition of Service Click <a href=""https://www.unv.org/become-volunteer/volunteer-abroad/conditions-of-service"">here</a> to view Conditions of Service</p>
<p><strong>Conditions of Service for International Specialist:</strong></p>
<p>The contract lasts for the period indicated above with possibility of extensions subject to availability of funding, operational necessity and satisfactory performance. However, there is no expectation of renewal of the assignment.</p>
<p>A UN Volunteer receives a Volunteer Living Allowance (VLA) which is composed of the Monthly Living Allowance (MLA) and a Family Allowance (FA) for those with dependents (maximum three).</p>
<p>The Volunteer Living Allowance (VLA) is paid at the end of each month to cover housing, utilities, transportation, communications and other basic needs. The VLA can be computed by applying the Post- Adjustment Multiplier (PAM) to the VLA base rate of US$ 1,631. The VLA base rate is a global rate across the world, while the PAM is duty station/country-specific and fluctuates on a monthly basis according to the cost of living. This method ensures that international UN Volunteers have comparable purchasing power at all duty stations irrespective of varying costs of living. The PAM is established by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) and is published at the beginning of every month on the ICSC website <a href=""http://icsc.un.org"">icsc.un.org</a>.</p>
<p>For UN Volunteer entitlements, kindly refer to the link <a href=""https://vmam.unv.org/calculator/entitlements"">vmam.unv.org/calculator/entitlements</a></p>
<p>In non-family duty stations that belong to hardship categories D or E, as classified by the ICSC, international UN Volunteers receive a Well-Being Differential (WBD) on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, UN Volunteers are provided a settling-in-grant (SIG) at the start of the assignment (if the volunteer did not reside in the duty station for at least 6 months prior to taking up the assignment) and in the event of a permanent reassignment to another duty station.</p>
<div title=""Page 7"">
<div>
<div>
<p>UNV provides life, health, permanent disability insurances as well as assignment travel, annual leave, full integration in the UN security framework (including residential security reimbursements).</p>
<p>UN Volunteers are paid Daily Subsistence Allowance at the UN rate for official travels, flight tickets for periodic home visit and for the final repatriation travel (if applicable). Resettlement allowance is paid for satisfactory service at the end of the assignment.</p>
<p>UNV will provide, together with the offer of assignment, a copy of the Conditions of Service, including Code of conduct, to the successful candidate.</p>
<p>Supervision, induction and duty of care of UN Volunteers</p>
<p>UN Volunteers should be provided equal duty of care as extended to all host entity personnel. Host entity support to the UN Volunteer includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>– Introductory briefings about the organisation and office-related context including security, emergency procedures, good cultural practice and orientation to the local environment;</p>
<p>– Support with arrival administration including setting-up of bank accounts, residence permit applications and completion of other official processes as required by the host government or host entity;</p>
<p>– Structured guidance, mentoring and coaching by a supervisor including a clear workplan and performance appraisal;</p>
<p>– Access to office space, equipment, IT support and any other systems and tools required to complete the objectives of the assignment including a host entity email address;</p>
<p>– Access to shared host entity corporate knowledge, training and learning; – Inclusion of the volunteer in emergency procedures such as evacuations; – Leave management;<br>
– DSA for official travel, when applicable;</p>
<p>– All changes in the Description of Assignment occurring between recruitment and arrival or during the assignment need to be formalized with the United Nations Volunteer Programme.</p>

<p>EMC Research is a full-service market research and analytics firm in business since 1989 with offices in Seattle, Oakland, Portland, Columbus, and Washington DC. We are looking to hire a developer to write an R package that will allow us to continue to produce our core crosstab deliverable. EMC Research currently uses SPSS 20 on our local workstations, primarily for survey data cleaning, analysis and creating deliverable-quality crosstabulations. In our existing configuration, we rely on SPSS Python Essentials and a custom Python (version 2.7) site package in order to transform SPSS output and generate our crosstab deliverables. Our users also use R and the RStudio IDE to weight survey data and other ad hoc analyses. With this new R package, we plan on replacing SPSS and Python completely and moving all cleaning, analysis and needed deliverable preparation to R. Note, the package we have found that can produce an output that most closely resembles our current deliverable is tableone (<a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableone/vignettes/introduction.html"">cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableon…</a>), but it is not adaptable enough for our purposes.</p>

<li>Ability to replicate or nearly replicate our current crosstab deliverable</li>
<li>Package functions have easy to understand syntax</li>
<li>Quick and reliable functions for weighted crosstabulations</li>
<li>Handles value and variable labels in a standard way that can be incorporated into basic data cleaning and manipulation</li>
<li>Minimal reliance on packages outside the R standard library</li>
<li>Minimal reliance on other languages, beyond R source code languages</li>
<li>Compatibility with the Tidyverse and the survey package, which will be used for basic cleaning and data manipulation</li>
<li>Robust documentation of package functions</li>

It is affiliated to the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and the Department of Water Resources and Environmental Modelling, under the direction of Dr. Martin Hanel. Building upon national and international collaborations, we are trying to analyze how climatic variability affects the water cycle components and vice versa. To achieve this we explore existing multi-source data or produce new ones from field measurements and computer simulations, develop sophisticated statistical and numerical methods to process them and apply novel approaches to visualize and present them. A main research line of the group is the study of extreme hydroclimatic events, and droughts in particular, as we are motivated by its severe socioeconomic consequences to current and future generations. Our research involves also the understanding and numerical modelling of physical processes related to atmosphere, hydrosphere including processes related to dynamics of soil and ground water and pollutant transport.</p>

<p>The hiring process has 4 stages:</p>
<p>We would like to know a bit about you other than what is normally in the CV. One characteristic of our company is that we are remote workers which measure results, not hours. The side-effect of this is that you will be quite free to manage your own time.</p>
<p>Which would be the positive and the negative aspects of this for you, personally?

<p>Long term job where you’d be part of a team which works closely together, figuratively. :)</p>
<p>The team is geographically distributed and trips to meet are rare.
Work hours are flexible but must be compatible as communication is fluid, therefore, we need you to be between UTC+3 and UTC-3 (this includes half of America, Europe, Middle East and Africa).
The work is Python backend development.</p>
<p>Systems are mostly REST services or message passing (brokered) agents.</p>
<p>Development is TDD, Python, OOP on Linux, organized in an agile fashion. Many AWS technologies are used but they are not a prerequisite.</p>
<p>We are looking for decent, self-managed, driven people who will care to produce good quality work and can work in a team effectively.</p>
<p>The salary offer will be between 40K and 55K €/year.</p>
<p>The hiring process has 4 stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We would like to know a bit about you other than what is normally in the CV. One characteristic of our company is that we are remote workers which measure results, not hours. The side-effect of this is that you will be quite free to manage your own time.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Which would be the positive and the negative aspects of this for you, personally?</li>
<li>H​ow do you manage yourself?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>An online quiz which should take about one hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A technical interview which should take between one and two hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, there will be a non-technical interview of about one hour.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are interested, please send your CV and the four answers to <a href=""mailto:hr@domainsbot.com"">hr@domainsbot.com</a>.</p>

<p>There are some skills which take long to develop, so it would be greatly beneficial to already have:</p>
<ul>
<li>The official company language is English and a very good level is required.</li>
<li>Five years of experience developing software is required.</li>
<li>Python takes months to master so good knowledge is required.</li>
<li>Experience with operations on Linux is important.</li>
