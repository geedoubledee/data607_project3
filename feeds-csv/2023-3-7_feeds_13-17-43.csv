<p>EquipmentShare is searching for a Principal Data Scientist to join our team. This position is fully remote.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do as a Principal Data Scientist</strong></p>
<p>Despite having been fundamentally altered by earlier industrial revolutions, the construction industry has hardly budged with the computer revolution. In fact, since 1970, labor productivity in the US construction industry has actually declined, despite it more than doubling in the rest of the economy. This has contributed to housing shortages and the parlous state of infrastructure in some places, and is sanding the gears of carbon reduction efforts.</p>
<p>We think the industry is ripe for change, and we’re pushing the leading edge of that change with our next generation <a>T3 Platform</a>, the OS for Construction. Through T3, we help contractors to coordinate humans and (increasingly smarter) machines to build more effectively.</p>

<p>Our mission is to change an entire industry, so we only hire people inspired by the goal and up for the challenge. In turn, our employees have every opportunity to grow with us, achieve personal and professional success and enjoy making a tangible difference in a crucial industry for human welfare.</p>

<li>8+ years working on technology-powered products in senior roles in data science, machine learning engineering, or a closely related discipline</li>
<li>Ability to think strategically about data science and machine learning within a growing company and a developing product</li>
<li>Strong cross-functional communication skills</li>

Our product search engine, one of the most heavily used services in the world, indexes billions of products and serves hundreds of millions of customers world-wide. We are working on a new initiative to transform our search engine into a shopping engine that assists customers with their shopping missions. We’re looking at every aspect of search, from query understanding to front-end UX, ranking and relevance, indexing and tiering and asking how we can make big step improvements by applying advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This is a rare opportunity to develop cutting edge ML solutions and apply them to a search problem of this magnitude. Some exciting questions that we expect to answer over the next few years include:<br><br>Can we deeply understand customer intent and personalize their search experience even when they type broad queries such as “dress” or “espresso machine”?<br>Can we reduce the cost of serving customer queries on Amazon by orders of magnitude using ML to predict n-grams and tuples that many queries decompose into, apply expensive ranking functions offline to identify the most relevant products that match these terms, and index these for efficient online retrieval? We expect this to lead to exciting research at the intersection of systems and ML.<br>Can we deeply understand the catalog to surface products that offer the most value to a customer? The challenge here is that the definition of value is subjective and personal, and therefore requires a deeper understanding of the customers intent as well as preferences.<br>Can we use deep learning to transfer behavioral signals from frequently purchased products in the head to products in the tail where behavioral signals are sparse? The challenge here is the scale, and the fact that the head and torso contain only a small fraction of products while the tail contains an overwhelmingly large fraction of the products in the catalog.<br>We have hired ML experts from leading research labs and academia to spearhead this effort.

Our commitment is not just surface level. We’re on a mission to create a safe space where everyone and anyone, regardless of their background, can thrive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s not just the right thing to do. We also recognise that diverse teams perform better because we have so much to learn from one another. We think that’s pretty cool, and if you do to then you’re in the right place.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have a hive of activity happening around the business to make sure we’re always pushing for more. Everyone is encouraged to get involved to help us to continue to build an excellent culture at Liberis.  </p>

<p><strong>Work on things that matter</strong><strong><br></strong>Ad Hoc is a digital services company that helps the federal government better serve people. Our teams use modern, agile methods to design and engineer government systems that connect Veterans with services, bring affordable health care to millions of people, and support important programs like Head Start. And as we work to make critical government services intuitive, accessible, and human-centered, we’re also changing how the government thinks about and uses technology.

<p><strong>What matters most</strong><br>Ad Hoc operates according to our commitment to inclusivity, acceptance, accountability, and humility. We aren’t heroes. We believe in missions larger than our individual selves and leave our egos at the door, learn from our mistakes, and iterate in order to better serve the people in our country. We prioritize building teams that represent the diversity of the people our government serves. We love the challenge of government-size projects. We want to bring skills to federal agencies, help them better meet the needs of their users, and close the gap between consumer expectations and government. </p>

We’ve designed our culture, communications, and tools to support a nationwide distributed team since the beginning. Being remote by design allows Ad Hoc to be thoughtful and intentional about creating diverse teams and supporting them with a work environment that fits their lives. With a generous PTO policy and Slack channels for every interest (from bird watching to space nerds to parenting) our culture embraces the things happening in your life. Maybe you need to adjust your schedule to care for your family or take a bike ride. At Ad Hoc, that’s embraced. </p>

<p>We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.</p>
<p>Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).</p>
<h3>About The Role:</h3>
<p>You will be a key business partner to the go-to-market leadership team across Sales, Customer Success, Marketing and Revenue Operations. Your work will be instrumental in setting what our data strategy looks like as we design and implement a <strong>best-in-class</strong> Go-to-Market motion. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core user engagement data set, or creating a model to identify high potential accounts, you'll absolutely be having impact on the direction of the business.</p>
<h3>What You'll Achieve:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You'll partner with Revenue Operations, Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing leads, driving forward all data science and analytics work in their functional areas</li>
<li>Synthesize insights into crisp narratives and present to senior leadership, and drive and verify change in our business processes. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)</li>
<li>You'll build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for making key decisions, and self-service tools and reports to enable business partners</li>
<li>You'll build models that are core to the operation of the business, such as revenue forecasting or identifying high-value accounts for more hands-on support</li>
<li>Partner closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skills You'll Need to Bring:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You've spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with Revenue Operations, Sales, Customer Success, Business Operations, and / or Finance related functions</li>
<li>You are a SQL expert. You have no problem regularly leveraging window functions, UDFs, self-joins, and other complex SQL functions to accomplish your data analysis goals</li>
<li>You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)</li>
<li>You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness</li>
<li>You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet</li>
<li>Creative and analytical thinker who can facilitate resolution to key design decisions in complex, cross-functional projects</li>
<li>You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy</li>
<li>Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nice to Haves:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Worked at a fast-growing start-up, a SaaS company or are eager to contribute in such an environment (being a current Notion user would also be great!)</li>
<li>Experience working with Sales, Customer Success, Revenue Operations, and/or Finance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>We are open to hiring junior or senior Data Analyst or Data Scientist, so please apply to this posting even if you believe you may be overqualified.</p>
<p>MoveOn is a diverse and vibrant community of millions of people working together to create progressive change in America. We are an innovative campaigning organization that supports people throughout the country to take action through driving impactful campaigns that influence the behavior of people and institutions, shape the outcomes of elections, and expand the realities of what’s possible. We organize to challenge entrenched power, while pursuing economic, racial, and social justice and a vision of a country in which everyone can thrive.</p>
<p>MoveOn has a particularly important role to play in the Trump era. We are working to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP in 2020 by building a powerful, multiracial, and economic populist movement that will give voters something to vote<em> for</em>, not just against—and we’re also working to defend communities that are on the front lines of Trump and GOP attacks, including immigrants, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and women. In service of that mission, in 2020 and beyond, MoveOn will drive impactful, movement-connected, multichannel, nimble campaigns aimed at impact.</p>
<p>The Data Analyst or Data Scientist will support MoveOn’s core 2020 election programs through the testing and analysis of analytics-based interventions, with the goals of maximizing volunteer engagement, increasing vote-by-mail applications, supporting our peer-to-peer fundraising program, and increasing turnout for Joe Biden and Democrats in the November election.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities may include …</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying, designing, and deploying analytics-based tactics that support MoveOn’s goal of defeating Donald Trump in November.</li>
<li>Conducting statistical analyses to identify best target audiences for various programs.</li>
<li>Evaluating the heterogeneous treatment impacts of alternative messages on subsets of our targeted populations of voters.</li>
<li>Designing and running randomized controlled trials to test innovative interventions to increase volunteer engagement and voter turnout.</li>
<li>Developing visualizations to communicate results and enhance campaign efforts.</li>
<li>Supporting fundraising initiatives to raise money for MoveOn and progressive candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>To be a successful candidate, you will …</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have experience working in data analytics &amp; statistics, specifically with large databases.</li>
<li>Be passionate about using analytics to drive progressive change.</li>
<li>Be clear about what you know and seek help for things you don’t know. We don’t expect you to be an expert in everything, but we do want someone who is willing to ask questions when needed.</li>
<li>Be a good communicator. The analysis work you conduct will help inform programmatic decisions for other teams across MoveOn. Being able to communicate results is critical to maximizing the impact of your work.</li>
<li>Be aware of data limitations. The data that forms the foundation of much of our analysis often has inherent biases that disproportionately impact marginalized or underrepresented populations. Being aware of and mitigating these biases when possible is important to help ensure that we aren’t leaving people out or exacerbating biases when implementing results in our programs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1+ years experience creating statistical models or applying machine learning in classification or predictive applications using statistical programming software like R, Python, Stata, or SAS.</li>
<li>Working with large datasets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Communicating technical results with a nontechnical audience.</li>
<li>Preferred but not required: designing and implementing randomized controlled trials.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Graduate-level degree (Ph.D. or master’s degree with relevant data science experience) in quantitative field.</li>

<p>Job title: Analyst</p>
<p>Company: Delta Hat Limited</p>
<p>Location: Long Eaton, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire</p>
<p>Salary: Dependent on qualifications and experience; 25k – 55k GBP</p>
<p>Job type: This is a permanent role. We are looking for candidates that are able to work for a substantial proportion of the working week, though this does not necessarily need to be full time. We have core company hours for which we would expect you to be in the office, with flexibility outside these hours.</p>
<p>Starting date: Negotiable – we would like someone in post as soon as possible but we are prepared to wait for the right candidate</p>
<h1>About Delta Hat</h1>
<p>Delta Hat is a small consultancy based near Nottingham providing industry-leading analysis to the pharmaceutical sector. We focus on the technical aspects of evidence-based medicine and health technology assessment, utilising methods such as cost-effectiveness modelling, propensity scoring, and meta-analysis. For the right candidate we offer a fascinating and well-paid career undertaking research on medicines and producing analyses that can directly influence clinical practice.</p>
<p>At Delta Hat, we provide a high level of senior input to the projects we undertake. This means you would spend the majority of your time working in close contact with senior members of staff. Collectively we have around 50 peer reviewed publications, and have contributed to over assessments of interventions, for a range of health conditions.</p>
<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<p>Your day-to-day work will involve the analysis and modelling of clinical trial data in a combination of the statistical software package R, and Microsoft Excel. This is then communicated to clients via face-to-face meetings, telephone calls and technical reports, with the potential to be published in journals and/or presented at industry conferences. You will be given responsibility from the outset and encouraged to develop a specialism and perform research in line with your interests and skillset.</p>
<h1>The role and requirements</h1>
<p>We are a small team with in-depth experience in statistics, health economics, and evidence-based medicine. We are looking for candidates with a similar depth of experience in programming, to help us improve the programming skillset of the Delta Hat team. Whilst ideally a candidate would have a relevant degree and potentially postgraduate qualification (for example in statistics, computer science, or other analysis based subject) this is not mandatory, and we would be open to a candidate with a demonstrable track record.</p>
<p>The position would involve learning and undertaking some aspects of the industry that we work in (medicine), but also to help us improve what we do by bringing in knowledge from adjacent disciplines. Most importantly Delta Hat is interested in adding a different skillset – implementing complex analyses, and improving the transparency, reproducibility and reducing runtime of our outputs.</p>
<p>The candidate we are looking for will have experience with programming; either formal training, or substantial on the job experience. Ideally this would be in R, SAS or VBA (the tools primarily used in our field), but the data handling skillset is more important than experience with the exact programming languages. An interest in analysing data to answer questions is essential.</p>
<p>Most importantly we are looking for someone who seeks a rewarding career, and has experience working in a project-based environment either within industry or academia. All candidates must have the right to work in the UK, and due to the sensitive nature of the work, are asked to declare any unspent convictions.</p>
<h1>Benefits</h1>
<p>We offer a compelling package for the right candidate. As well as a salary commensurate with the work, we offer generous amounts of annual leave (equating to around 35 days including bank holidays) and excellent equipment. As the company is small, you will have a meaningful say in how it is run, and the type of work we take on. Further to this, a share of company profits is distributed amongst staff annually.</p>
<p>Because of the high level of exposure to a variety of projects we anticipate you would develop quickly, and we will coach and support you to enable this. We are keen to aid your professional development which may involve sending you on courses, attending conferences, or taking a range of different roles on projects. Our staff are our main asset, and we invest in them accordingly.</p>
<p>Whilst the salary range is extremely wide, this is to reflect our openness to candidates at different levels – from a candidate with extensive experience in a highly related field, to a (relatively) recent graduate with limited directly transferrable skills.</p>",https://www.r-users.com/jobs/r-programmer-analyst-nottingham-uk/,https://extract.feedbin.com/parser/feedbin/a2cb97e5ac0dd4dd6c47e594b872717bc6f92693?base64_url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuci11c2Vycy5jb20vam9icy9yLXByb2dyYW1tZXItYW5hbHlzdC1ub3R0aW5naGFtLXVrLw==,2019-11-22T20:12:40.000000Z,2019-11-22T20:26:47.253664Z

<p><strong>Assignment Details</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assignment Title</strong> Population Data Fellow, Vital Statistics Capacity Building (NY) <strong>Organizational Context &amp; Project Description</strong></p>
<p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)</p>
<p>UNFPA is the United Nations Population Fund. Our mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.</p>
<p>UNFPA supports:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reproductive health care for women and youth in more than 150 countries – which are home to more than 80 per cent of the world’s population</li>
<li>The health of pregnant women, especially the 1 million who face life-threatening complications each month</li>
<li>Reliable access to modern contraceptives sufficient to benefit 20 million women a year</li>
<li>Training of thousands of health workers to help ensure at least 90 per cent of all childbirths are supervised by skilled attendants</li>
<li>Prevention of gender-based violence, which affects 1 in 3 women</li>
<li>Abandonment of female genital mutilation, which harms 3 million girls annually</li>
<li>Prevention of teen pregnancies, complications of which are the leading cause of death for girls 15-19 years old</li>
<li>Efforts to end child marriage, which could affect an estimated 70 million girls over the next 5 years</li>
<li>Delivery of safe birth supplies, dignity kits and other life-saving materials to survivors of conflict and natural disaster</li>
<li>Censuses, data collection and analyses, which are essential for development planning</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data Fellows Programme</strong></p>
<p>UNFPA will host its inaugural cohort of Population Data Fellows in its global headquarters (New York) and selected regional and country offices around the world in 2019-2020. Through this programme, Population Data Fellows will come together to design and deliver targeted projects that contribute to the overall population data work of UNFPA.</p>
<p>The inaugural cohort of 2019-2020 Population Data Fellows will contribute to UNFPA’s work on civil registration and vital statistics in the areas of</p>
<p>(1) qualitative population field research,<br>
(2) data analytics of vital registration data, and<br>
(3) capacity building in completeness assessment, demographic data quality assessment and vital statistics analysis.</p>
<div title=""Page 3"">
<div>
<div>
<p>The Fellowship programme will be residential for a period of up to 12-months (possible extension subject to available funding), with Fellows living at a specific UNFPA duty station and working in the associated UNFPA office under the direction of either the Country Office’s UNFPA Representative, the Regional Office’s Population and Development Regional Advisor, or the Population and Development Branch Chief at UNFPA Headquarters.</p>
<p>Qualitative Population Field Research</p>
<p>This program of work at UNFPA seeks to understand the proximate determinants of under-registration of vital events across the life course, including registration of births, marriages, divorces, and deaths. Through qualitative research – primarily through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews – UNFPA is seeking to understand why certain subpopulations are more likely to have their vital events registered than others. Further, this work seeks to understand the social, economic and political consequences for individuals of being invisible to the civil registration system. This work will be closely aligned with large-scale data analysis of civil registration, census and survey data.</p>
<p>Data Analytics of vital event registration data</p>
<p>In order to systematically strengthen CRVS systems, we need to understand how complete they are and the quality of the underlying data. This is important to identity which areas of the system need further improvement, and it is also is needed to make adjustments to civil registration data when producing representative and reliable vital statistics at national and subnational levels. Fellows engaged in this workstream will support analysis and assessment of civil registration data under the guidance of UNFPA technical staff.</p>
<p>Capacity building in completeness assessment, demographic data quality assessment and vital statistics analysis</p>
<p>UNFPA supports National Statistics Offices in low- and middle-income countries via technical capacity building. This workstream involves development of capacity building materials and support to training workshops for National Statistics Offices and Civil Registration authorities in the area of civil registration data assessment, vital statistics production, and vital statistics usage.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Development Goals 17</strong>. Partnerships For the Goals Task description</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of Chief, Population and Development Branch, the UN Volunteer will:</p>
<ul>

<p>EMC Research is a full-service market research and analytics firm in business since 1989 with offices in Seattle, Oakland, Portland, Columbus, and Washington DC. We are looking to hire a developer to write an R package that will allow us to continue to produce our core crosstab deliverable. EMC Research currently uses SPSS 20 on our local workstations, primarily for survey data cleaning, analysis and creating deliverable-quality crosstabulations. In our existing configuration, we rely on SPSS Python Essentials and a custom Python (version 2.7) site package in order to transform SPSS output and generate our crosstab deliverables. Our users also use R and the RStudio IDE to weight survey data and other ad hoc analyses. With this new R package, we plan on replacing SPSS and Python completely and moving all cleaning, analysis and needed deliverable preparation to R. Note, the package we have found that can produce an output that most closely resembles our current deliverable is tableone (<a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableone/vignettes/introduction.html"">cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableon…</a>), but it is not adaptable enough for our purposes.</p>
<p>Project criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>R package that can be run on a local machine (must run on: Windows 10 Pro; 8 GB RAM; i7; or newer)</li>
<li>Ability to replicate or nearly replicate our current crosstab deliverable</li>
<li>Package functions have easy to understand syntax</li>
<li>Quick and reliable functions for weighted crosstabulations</li>
<li>Handles value and variable labels in a standard way that can be incorporated into basic data cleaning and manipulation</li>
<li>Minimal reliance on packages outside the R standard library</li>
<li>Minimal reliance on other languages, beyond R source code languages</li>
<li>Compatibility with the Tidyverse and the survey package, which will be used for basic cleaning and data manipulation</li>
<li>Robust documentation of package functions</li>
<li>Ability to train our lead users (2 – 3) on using the new packages so that we can train staff</li>
<li>Interested in pursuing an ongoing relationship to support the package at the conclusion of the development contract</li>
<li><strong>Timeline: alpha version by April 22, testing with lead users late April – early May; beta version by May 20; documentation, training and support May/June; availability for future upgrades/support as needed</strong></li>
<li>Our budget is $10K to $15K</li>

It is affiliated to the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and the Department of Water Resources and Environmental Modelling, under the direction of Dr. Martin Hanel. Building upon national and international collaborations, we are trying to analyze how climatic variability affects the water cycle components and vice versa. To achieve this we explore existing multi-source data or produce new ones from field measurements and computer simulations, develop sophisticated statistical and numerical methods to process them and apply novel approaches to visualize and present them. A main research line of the group is the study of extreme hydroclimatic events, and droughts in particular, as we are motivated by its severe socioeconomic consequences to current and future generations. Our research involves also the understanding and numerical modelling of physical processes related to atmosphere, hydrosphere including processes related to dynamics of soil and ground water and pollutant transport.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>A global, independent think tank on the integration of long-term and climate-related objectives and risks into financial market metrics, processes and regulation.</p>
<p>Since it was set up in 2012 with the mission to align financial markets with climate goals, the 2° Investing Initiative (2°ii) has become a pioneering think tank – with offices in Berlin, Paris, London and New York – on the integration of long-term risks and policy objectives into financial markets and regulatory frameworks. 2°ii developed the first scenario analysis tool linking financial portfolios to public policy objectives – specifically the 2°C climate goal – which is now applied to over $10 trillion assets under management across more than 1,000 financial institutions, as well as a number of financial supervisors. 2°ii co-designed the first climate-related financial regulation in the world (Art. 173 of the French Energy Transition Law).  A core principle of its mission is to reduce the transaction costs across companies, financial institutions and policymakers, while guiding financial markets towards the long-term future.</p>
<p>Current research includes development of climate alignment tools for banks, market outlook reports and enhancement of existing, analytical methods as well as a sustainability-ready, open-source robo-adviser. 2°ii has a multi-stakeholder and independent governance framework designed to ensure the intellectual integrity of its work and its independence.

Long term job where you’d be part of a team which works closely together, figuratively. :)</p>
<p>The team is geographically distributed and trips to meet are rare. Work hours are flexible but must be compatible as communication is fluid, therefore, we need you to be between UTC+3 and UTC-3 (this includes half of America, Europe, Middle East and Africa). The work is Python backend development.</p>
<p>Systems are mostly REST services or message passing (brokered) agents.</p>
<p>Development is TDD, Python, OOP on Linux, organized in an agile fashion. Many AWS technologies are used but they are not a prerequisite.</p>
<p>We are looking for decent, self-managed, driven people who will care to produce good quality work and can work in a team effectively.</p>
<p>The salary offer will be between 40K and 55K €/year.</p>
<p>The hiring process has 4 stages:</p>
<p>We would like to know a bit about you other than what is normally in the CV. One characteristic of our company is that we are remote workers which measure results, not hours. The side-effect of this is that you will be quite free to manage your own time.</p>
<p>Which would be the positive and the negative aspects of this for you, personally?
H​ow do you manage yourself?</p>

<p>Requirements
There are some skills which take long to develop, so it would be greatly beneficial to already have:</p>
<p>The official company language is English and a very good level is required.
Five years of experience developing software is required.

<ol>
<li>
<p>We would like to know a bit about you other than what is normally in the CV. One characteristic of our company is that we are remote workers which measure results, not hours. The side-effect of this is that you will be quite free to manage your own time.</p>

<li>Which would be the positive and the negative aspects of this for you, personally?</li>
<li>H​ow do you manage yourself?</li>
</ul>

<p>An online quiz which should take about one hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A technical interview which should take between one and two hours.</p>
