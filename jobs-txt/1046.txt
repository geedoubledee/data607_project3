Brief description You will join the growing feature engineering team within 6point6 data practice. The anticipated project work involves hands-on machine learning and data science (particularly in deep learning areas); from innovation through to deployment using MLOps best practice. We set high standards for delivering excellent work to clients and have fostered a happy, productive and multi-disciplined team to enable us to do this effectively. We welcome applications from candidates who have a breadth of skills including software engineering and cloud knowledge, as well as cloud, and being comfortable in a client-facing role.  It is expected that you would have conducted numerous data science projects and recognise the pitfalls to help ensure our clients donâ€™t make them. You will also have an opportunity to contribute to the 6point6 internal data practice strategy and thought leadership and shape our team as it continues to grow.Role and responsibilities Keep up to date with current high impact work in the machine learning field, specialising in one area such as deep learning Lead and/or develop solutions to problems using machine learning techniques and MLOps practice Innovate with new ideas and provide thought leadership on client projects Communicate findings, results or proposals internally and externally (such as presentation and documentation) Identify and help address gaps in knowledge in the feature engineering team and within project work RequirementsEssential  Candidates should have a PhD or strong undergraduate results in physics, mathematics, statistics, computer science, machine learning, data science, or related discipline. This is in part a theoretical role and you should be comfortable with the mathematical underpinnings of data science algorithms and translating them to code.  Experience in python (3+ years) Experience using numerical/language libraries for data science. Examples: tensorflow, pytorch, jax, numpy, spacy Knowledge of good working practices in software/agile/knowledge sharing, particularly in small teams Strong understanding of approaches to problem solving using statistical methods or modelling Excellent written and verbal communication skills Additional desirable skills:Experience working with unstructured data (text, images) Experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deploying machine learning models Ability to translate paper to code Up to date knowledge of NLP models and datasets Developing solutions using machine learning or deep learning in a commercial environment Comfortable using the cloud for data processing and machine learning project
