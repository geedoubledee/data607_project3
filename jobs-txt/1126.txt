About the job
Alternative job titles: NLP Engineer, NLP Research Engineer, AI Engineer, Software Engineer (NLP), Research Engineer


After years of heads-down research, a start-up founded by AI luminary is at an exciting commercialization phase. Ready to scale up its NLU technology that is able to collaborate, reason, and comprehend with human-level fluency. They've built novel natural language technology that allows a system to learn in a similar way to how a child learns language; allowing for rich comprehension of the text it is processing and generating.


As a research engineer, you will be responsible for scaling up complex language models which combine NLP, ML, deep learning, automated reasoning, formal logic, and more.


This role requires deep knowledge of core language models, deep learning frameworks, distributed computing, and large-scale data processing. You will collaborate closely with seasoned researchers to deploy SOTA ML and NLP models.


Minimum requirements:

Master's Degree or above in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or equivalent
Expertise in writing clean production-level code
Experience working end-to-end deploying models into production at scale
Min. 2 years of experience building systems based on machine learning and deep learning methods
Deep knowledge of (Transformer-based) language models and their underlying mechanics
Proficiency with the following; Python and Java, deep learning libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow or equivalent), HuggingFace

Good-to-have:

First principle approach to problem-solving
Ability to describe complex problems in a logical manner
Roll-your-sleeves up approach to projects, willingness and desire to get stuck into ML plumbing/Ops issues when needed
Proficiency with: PyCharm, GCP, K8s, Docker

Keywords: NLP, NLU, Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Transformers, HuggingFace
