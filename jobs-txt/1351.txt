IntroductionPhysicsX is a deep-tech company of scientists and engineers, developing machine learning applications to massively accelerate physics simulations and enable a new frontier of optimization opportunities in design and engineering.  Born out of numerical physics and proven in Formula One, we help our customers radically improve their concepts and designs, transform their engineering processes and drive operational product performance. We do this in some of the most advanced and important industries of our time – including Space, Aerospace, Medical Devices, Additive Manufacturing, Electric Vehicles, Motorsport, and Renewables. Our work creates positive impact for society, be it by improving the design of artificial hearts, reducing CO2 emissions from aircraft and road vehicles, and increasing the performance of wind turbines.   We are a rapidly growing and profitable company but prefer to fly under the radar to protect our customers’ confidentiality. We are about to take the next leap in building out our technology platform and product offering. In this context, we are looking for a capable and enthusiastic machine learning engineer to join our team. If all of this sounds exciting to you, we would love to talk (even if you don't tick all the boxes).
What you will do
 Help shape some of our key product engineering areas – software development standards, frameworks, testing and release processWork closely with our simulation engineers, data scientists and customers to develop an understanding of the physics and engineering challenges we are solvingWork closely with product management to identify new opportunities for the product engineering teamDesign and develop python libraries that solve complex problems in applying machine learning to design and engineeringWrite high-quality code that allow us to create scalable and reliable machine learning librariesUse common libraries for 3D mesh data manipulation and deep learning such as PyVista, JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorchExplore new techniques and frameworks to integrate into our tech stack (as technology evolves, we strive for making relevant changes on our stack when needed)What you bring to the table
Enthusiasm about building machine learning products for science and engineeringDegree in computer science, software engineering or equivalent2+ years’ experience in a product engineering role, with exposure to:Implementing python libraries using OOP principlesUsing numerical and deep learning frameworks (e.g., JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch)Applying software engineering principles around testing, code reviews and deploymentUsing distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Ray)Docker for development and deploymentUsing 3D mesh data manipulation frameworks (e.g., PyVista) is a plusExperience in CAD/CFD/FEA is a plusBeing comfortable with deep learning algorithms and linear algebra is a plusExcellent collaboration and communication skills - with teams and usersWhat we offer
Be part of something larger: Make an impact and meaningfully shape an early-stage company. Work on some of the most exciting and important topics there are. Do something you can be proud ofWork with a fun group of colleagues that support you, challenge you and help you grow. We come from many different backgrounds, but what we have in common is the desire to operate at the very top of our fields and solve truly challenging problems in science and engineering. If you are similarly capable, caring and driven, you'll find yourself at home hereExperience a truly flat hierarchy. Voicing your ideas is not only welcome but encouraged, especially when they challenge the status quoWork sustainably, striking the right balance between work and personal life. Be able to properly switch off in the evening and during weekends. What matters is the quality of our workReceive a competitive compensation and equity package, in addition to plenty of perks such as generous vacation and parental leave, complimentary office food, as well as fun outings and events Work in a flexible setting, with your choice of either our lovely London Shoreditch or Bicester Heritage offices to collaborate in, and a good proportion from home if so desired. Get the opportunity to occasionally visit our customers' engineering sites and experience first-hand how our work is transforming their ways of working  Use first-class equipment for working in-office or remotely, including HPCOur stanceWe value diversity and are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of sex, race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, age, sexual orientation or gender identity. We strongly encourage individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech to apply. To help make a change, we sponsor bright women from disadvantaged backgrounds through their university degrees in science and mathematics.
