Cognitiv leverages deep learning artificial intelligence to build custom algorithms that more accurately and efficiently predict consumer purchase behavior. Each marketer has a unique set of goals, which is why Cognitiv created NeuralMind, a deep learning platform capable of automatically building custom algorithms that simultaneously consider the user, the context, the message, and the campaign objectives. We combine deterministic data and advanced processing techniques to continuously train these algorithms as they optimize our clients’ key performance indicators (KPIs), predicting consumer behavior in order to autonomously drive full-funnel marketing performance at scale.The Director of Machine Learning Research will be based in Berkeley, CA and will lead a team of research scientists working on developing techniques for modeling complex sequential behavioral datasets using methods such as recurrent networks, transformers, and reinforcement learning. The Director will be responsible for overseeing the complete modeling lifecycle, including problem framing, dataset construction, objective function and architecture definition, model training, visualization, and results analysis. The position will have a hybrid work schedule of 3 days in the office (Mon/Tue/Wed) and 2 days remote (Thursday/Friday) and is the same across all business units/office locations.
