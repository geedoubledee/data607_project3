Welcome to the future of medicine. At Unlearn, our purpose is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate trial and error in medicine. Today, we are reimagining the randomized control trial (RCT) for the 21st century through TwinRCTs. A TwinRCT is an AI-powered RCT that allows more trial patients to receive the experimental treatment and takes significantly less time than a traditional RCT. Unlearn’s innovative work in AI today will reinvent how AI is applied in medicine tomorrow—and we have a top secret plan for how to get there. We won’t be able to achieve this mission just by applying technologies created by others; the future must be invented.Unlearn is a technology company, not a biotech company. We use computers, not pipettes. We make and use software, we don’t discover or make drugs. We believe that AI will define the future of medicine, and we aren’t deterred by naysayers or skeptics. We come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from machine learning to marketing—but regardless of where we come from, Unlearners share some common traits:>> Unlearners are ambitious; we aren’t intimidated by big, challenging goals. >> Unlearners are disciplined experimenters; we break down our big goals into smaller chunks and meet as often as  necessary to track our velocity and iterate quickly. >> Unlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.>> Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo. >> Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too               important to be boring.  And, last but not least,>> Unlearners are team-oriented; we put the mission first, the company second, the team third, and individuals last.Founded in 2017 by a team of world-class machine learning scientists, we have raised venture capital from top tier investors such as Insight Partners, Radical Ventures, 8VC, DCVC, and DCVC Bio. We completed our $50 million Series B in April 2022. We are headquartered in San Francisco, CA and have an additional office in Boston, MA.If our purpose and culture resonate with you, please join us. Data Scientists working on our Clinical Data teams at Unlearn are responsible for building world class internal data products that enable fundamental advancements in machine learning.  Data Scientists collaborate as part of multi-disciplinary teams to leverage high-quality software to build datasets and tailor them for use in machine learning.  These teams work across disease areas, constantly learning and growing their capabilities to deliver innovative solutions around clinical data.
