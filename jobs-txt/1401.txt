You apply through the form on the website https://apexive.com/vacancies/senior-python-django-engineer and send a fragment of your recent code using Django and Django-rest-framework that you are proud of. Please take this step seriously as we base our decision on moving forward with the candidate solely on what you send us, and we do not give a benefit of the doubt at this stage.
If your code meets our expectations, you‚Äôll have a short cultural-fit interview, so we can get to know each other better, understand your motivation for applying, and make sure you know all the important things about us.
You‚Äôll be asked to do a test assignment - most likely as a contribution to an open-source project.
We‚Äôll finish with a technical interview with the main architect & CTO.
