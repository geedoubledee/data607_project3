Our hiring partner is a Fintech company whose mission is to connect people with their passions.

They reach millions of enthusiasts through editorial brands like Cycle World and Cycle Volta and helps consumers buy their favorite products with instant, frictionless financing. Our partner is revolutionizing lending in under-served verticals that account for tens of billions of dollars in annual transactions.
