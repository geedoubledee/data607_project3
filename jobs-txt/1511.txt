Overview
The Data Engineering and Services team build systems that bridge the gap between raw business data and consumable data products that customers can trust and take action on. We accomplish this by providing our data science partners with AI/ML development, experimentation, and production environments with access to an elastic, distributed model training and inference infrastructure. What that actually looks like is working with folks from across the Product, Marketing, and Customer departments to understand their needs and then surface data, predictions, or AI/ML model in the most useful format. We make data science workflows repeatable, scalable, and observable while reducing toil and increasing release velocity.
