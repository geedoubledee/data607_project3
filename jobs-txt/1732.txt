Why join
Growth and impact. It's not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded startup that's scaling. That means that instead of following a playbook, you'll be writing it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You'll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn't when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.

Equity in the company in the form of stock options
