Successful candidates for the Senior Manager, Data Scientist role will have experience using large sets of statistical and mathematical data, and have the predictive modeling and business strategy skills to build the algorithms necessary to form data driven decisions. They should be confident in their ability to communicate their findings, orally and visually. They should have experience leading, managing and developing other data analysts. Finally, they should be able to quickly build an understanding of how Netspend financial products are developed, perform in the payments space and how Netspend customers use Netspend products in their financial lives.
Candidates must be naturally curious and enjoy diving deep into a data set to find answers to as yet unknown and potentially unasked questions. They need to have a natural desire to go beneath the surface of a problem and be thinkers who can ask the right (business) questions. They need to be confident and self-secure in their methods, realizing that working within massive data sets requires lot of time and patience as developing new algorithms and new insights often involves a trial-and-error process.
Success in this role also requires understanding of how to integrate multiple systems and data sets; i.e., the ability to link and mash up distinctive data sets to discover new insights. This often requires being able to work with potentially incomplete data sources and cleaning data sets prior to using them. It also requires the ability to lead, manage and develop a small team of data analysts.
