Hi,
I hope you're having a good day! I'm reaching out to you to check whether you are open/looking for a new contract opportunity for a Data Engineer remote role. Please reply to me for more details.
Title – Data Engineer
Duration – 12 month w/ extension possible
Location – Omaha, NE or remote
Main skills I’ll be assessing of
Native Python programming knowledge, need to be experts here
ETL tool experience, particularly DataStage
Must have Docker, Jenkins, Kafka and GIT experience
Operating in an on-prem DB@ environment
Prior Life & health Insurance
Overall Data Engineering experience 12+ years
Working independently and directly with business on requirements
We’ve placed for this role in the past and need better skillsets in place and industry experience –
More seniority – they basically have a lot of individual engineers that they have to hand hold or teach. They want someone to come in and show PMIC how it’s done, not the other way around.
Prior Insurance industry experience – what we’ve come to learn is that outside their PMO, there is no functional roles like BA’s to act as a buffer between the business and technical. That means a engineer at PMIC has to interact regularly with business users and be very knowledgeable about insurance terminology, processes, and procedures.
BA skillset - With the lack of a BA, the role itself is more like a 65/35 split, where a data engineer is coding 65% of the time, and 35% of the time acting as their own BA. Since there’s no detailed requirements, having the skillset to define your elicit, define and execute off their own.
