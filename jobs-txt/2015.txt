Who are we:
We are an innovative award winning software company that utilizes its proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) platform to find, analyze, and organize dynamically unstructured data found within any type of business document.

TackleAI is the modern solution to handle this data overload. It is like no other software.

We are revolutionizing the artificial intelligence industry!
