Robust understanding of the machine learning and data science technical ecosystems (e.g., Tensorflow, Pytorch, MLflow, Seldon, Kubeflow, Data lakes, Snowflake, SageMaker, Scikit, etc.)
Deep understanding of Machine Learning best practices (e.g. training/serving skew minimization, A/B test, feature engineering, feature/model selection), algorithms (e.g. gradient boosted trees, neural networks/deep learning, optimization), and domains (e.g. natural language processing, computer vision, personalization and recommendation, anomaly detection)
Industry experience building end-to-end Machine Learning infrastructure and/or building Machine Learning models
An understanding of the cost of software development/tech debt and long-term maintenance
Passion for customers and seeking a deep understanding of end-user problems as well as competitive and market trends in the A.I. space
