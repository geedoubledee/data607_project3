Engineer, Machine Learning
The mission of the Allen Institute is to unlock the complexities of bioscience and advance our knowledge to improve human health. Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.
The Allen Institute for Cell Science builds open-source community tools that make cell biology more accessible to more people in order to foster scientific collaboration and discovery. Our team is composed of highly dedicated and creative people with diverse backgrounds and skill sets who work together on cutting edge development projects. We seek to grow our talented team and to build an environment that nurtures software engineers at all stages of their career. Join our inclusive team to pursue your passion of using software engineering to increase scientific and societal impact.
We seek a talented engineer to join the Modeling Team to help build, analyze, and deploy sophisticated computational models of cell states and dynamic cellular processes based on 3D live cell imaging generated in our Institute. The role of this position is to collaboratively develop and maintain code and computational infrastructure to enable the efficient implementation and deployment of modern deep learning architectures - on-premises and in the cloud. This includes taking part in the development of a configurable deep learning framework, serotiny. This framework will enable our Institute and the research community at-large to perform cell biological pattern recognition on 3D live cell microscopy image data - with the ultimate goal of elucidating cellular organization and cellular state transitions. Research at the Institute is highly collaborative, requiring scientists and engineers to work across disciplines, focusing on high impact biological questions and establishing/maintaining the highest standards for best practices and computational rigor. Examples of relevant projects are here and here.
The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences, and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.
