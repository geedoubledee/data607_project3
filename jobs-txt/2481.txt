Machine Learning Engineer
Remote Working
Contract or Permanent

I'm looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join a stealth mode start up and help them build machine learning models for a music / audio related project.

This is a VC-backed start up with plenty of resource, knowledge and ambition to build something truly great.

This Machine Learning Engineer role is one of their first crucial hires, focussed on taking their technology from concept to MVP in the short term, and with the long term opportunity to be part of a game-changing company in the music tech world.

I'm therefore looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who has experience working with music / audio projects and is comfortable taking a lead role in product development.
