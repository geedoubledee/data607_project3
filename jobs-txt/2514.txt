The American Constitution Society (ACS) believes that our laws and legal systems should be forces to improve and protect the lives of all people. ACS works for progressive legal reform by shaping debate on our most pressing legal and constitutional challenges; with our nationwide network of lawyers, law students, judges, scholars, activists, and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values and rights.
ACS is looking for a highly organized and skilled Database Associate. This position would report to the IT Director, and is currently offered as fully remote; however, it will be required of the employee to attend ACS in-person events (minimum of two per year).
