				Director, Scientific Data Division – 97574
Division:  DD-Data Science
 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is seeking an experienced scientific leader with an outstanding record of research accomplishments in data science, computer science, computational science, applied math, or related fields to serve as the Director of the Scientific Data (SciData) Division.
 
About the Position:
This is an unparalleled opportunity to lead a research division that is internationally recognized for excellence in computer science, data science, and computational research, and to foster an environment that supports high-quality scientific research in foundational and groundbreaking fields and further advances in data-intensive computational science.
 
The SciData Division Director oversees a staff of 100 employees and affiliates and an annual budget of $30 million. Responsibilities include:
• Providing vision and leadership for the Division;
• Overseeing research, operations, finance, human resources, and environmental health and safety;
• Establishing a culture of excellence and inclusion by recruiting a diverse team of outstanding scientists and staff, enthusiastically supporting and promoting their career development; and
• Advancing Berkeley Lab’s stewardship values of team science, innovation, trust, respect, and service, including building and maintaining a culture that is committed to the ideals of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accountability.
 
Reporting to the Associate Laboratory Director for Computing Sciences, the SciData Director serves as a member of the executive team of the Computing Sciences Area, comprising the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), Scientific Networking, and Applied Mathematics and Computational Research Divisions in addition to the SciData Division. The Director builds collaborative partnerships and programs within the Computing Sciences Area, with other Divisions at Berkeley Lab, and with external research institutions to contribute to large-scale, multidisciplinary initiatives, such as quantum information science and Artificial Intelligence.
 
About the Scientific Data Division:
The SciData Division transforms data-driven discovery and understanding through the development and application of novel data science methods, technologies, and infrastructures in partnership with science domain experts. Its work in machine learning involves researching, developing and sharing the algorithms, software, tools, and libraries that are fundamental to scientific machine learning. The Division builds tools and models that transform data generated by simulations, experiments, and observations to a form that researchers can manipulate to gain scientific insight. It advances and leverages data management, analytics, and security techniques to solve important problems in scientific cyber infrastructure and energy delivery systems. The Division also leads software engineering, software release management, and software development efforts that promote the visibility, usability, reliability, and sustainability of software products in domains from chemical engineering to high-energy physics.
 
Just as research and development programs benefit science, domain scientists influence and contribute to the direction and content of SciData’s research. SciData works in partnership with a variety of experts in domains ranging from biology and materials science to fundamental physics and climate science to develop tools, techniques, and technologies to meet the data-analysis challenges posed by present and future experimental, observational, and simulation data. SciData researchers regularly win Best Paper awards, are called upon to give keynote addresses at international conferences, and develop leading-edge software that researchers worldwide use to produce impactful results.
 
The SciData Division has a diverse funding portfolio, including from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science. Learn more about the SciData Division here.
