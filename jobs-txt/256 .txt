About the Company
        We, at DPDzero, are building end to end collections suite. The current collections eco-system is working in a disconnected manner and the focus is on the lending business as the growth depends on it. Collections are one of the core processes of any lending business where our goal is to manage the entire collections process with data-driven real-time insights, automation, and zero integration efforts.
The dream of every lender is to reach DPDzero (this is a collection of industry-standard terminology) and we are building the most innovative and intelligent system that helps achieve this goal. Lenders of all sizes can now get full visibility into their borrower portfolio and start making data-driven decisions to automate their collections.
