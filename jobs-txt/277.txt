About the Company
        Spend Network ([https://spendnetwork.com](https://spendnetwork.com)) is a data analysis company dedicated to gathering and analysing public contracting data. We’re a small, friendly team that cares about being inclusive and doing good work. We’re open to remote working and flexible working. So we'd be really happy to work with someone who was returning to work, could only work 9-to-3, or needed a job share. We’re inquisitive, supportive and diligent. We are looking for someone to work with us over the long term, so that you can improve your skills and our products.
We work with procurement data and have the largest, open database of tenders in the world (you can see some of it here: [https://openopps.com](https://openopps.com/)). We sell our data to businesses and Governments, but also make the data available for free to academics, journalists and activists.
