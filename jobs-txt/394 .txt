Aquabyte is seeking a Computer Vision Engineer to help develop and deploy new algorithms to fish farms across the world. You’ll be responsible for research and model development to improve our on-camera processing as well as owning the production software running on the cameras.Watch our TV episode with Amazon’s CTO at a Norwegian fish farm here! https://youtu.be/YZ_qJ5JFD3IOur missionAquabyte is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea and preserve it for generations to come.We are a diverse, mission-driven team that is eager to work alongside kindred spirits. If this vision makes you smile, gives you goosebumps, or otherwise inspires you please get in touch.Our productWe are currently focused on helping salmon farmers better understand their fish population and make environmentally sound decisions. Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect the health status, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.Above all, Aquabyte is a customer-driven company. Our product development is dictated by the needs of fish farmers and we prioritize customer delight in everything we do. We are committed to build a global, collaborative team that creates value far beyond Silicon Valley.The roleAs a Computer Vision Engineer you will be responsible for doing the research and software engineering to improve the intelligence and efficiency of our camera system. This role is on the Biomass team where we focus on understanding the weight and size of individual fish and fish populations. You will be joining our small yet powerful research team, and will work closely alongside engineers with years of industry and academic experience.DutiesTraining computer vision models to improve our fish detection, tracking, and more on our subsea camera.Optimizing deep learning models so they can run with lower latency on the edge.Researching methods for new product features or to improve our existing weight estimation systemWriting production code to run model inference real-time and communicate with our cloud services.\Colaborate with other engineering and product teams to scope product featuresDevelop tests to ensure algorithm correctness and and prepare software for deploymentRequired skillsBS/MS in relevant technical degree2+ years of experience with building computer vision software Strong coding ability; strong grasp of PythonDesired skillsExperience with both classical and deep learning based computer vision Experience optimizing model inference for real-time inference on limited resourcesStrong software engineering skills; knowledge of best practices, testing, and deploymentFamiliarity with stereo vision, 3D reconstruction, and stereo calibrationExperience deploying models to NVIDIA Jetson boards or similar resource constrained environmentsBenefitsEnjoy excellent benefits, including equity in the company, medical/dental/vision, and a 401k programEvolve in a very fast-paced environment with rapid iterationBe able to shape a business in its early daysGet ideas, feedback, and suggestions from other best-in-their-field colleaguesClosingAquabyte is a private company headquartered in San Francisco, and is supported by NEA, Costanoa Ventures, and many other respected investors.At Aquabyte, we admire interesting people with a unique background.
