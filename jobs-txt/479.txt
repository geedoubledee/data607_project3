About the Company
        ASPER BROTHERS is a dev shop/software house with an office in the very center of Warsaw. We are characterized by a friendly approach, passion for the latest technologies, and pedantic work.
We have a team of 25 great people, and we’re growing steadily. Some at the office (in good times), and some remotely from different Polish cities.
Our clients are friendly, smiling people, so working for them is a pleasure. Among our clients, you very rarely meet non-technical people, so we talk to them in a “common language.”
We want to cooperate with people who will have a real impact on the direction, shape, and development of projects every day. We believe in self-sufficient scrum teams.
