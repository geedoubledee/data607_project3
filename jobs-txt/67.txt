About CalliperAt Calliper, we believe that data should be for the many, not the few. Data is one of the most valuable assets companies have. Yet, most struggle to unlock its potential. We're here to change that.We help companies win by making better decisions with data, faster. Calliper is a mission control centre for the whole company - making data accessible and actionable for everyone.Aggregate fragmented sources. Remove noise. Align teams.This is Collaborative Analytics.We're a fast-growing startup backed by Sequoia and 35+ operator angels and late-stage startup founders who have first-hand experienced the challenges of building data-driven organisations. See a short demo of what we are building here.As a company, we deeply care about our people and the culture we‚Äôre building. Learn more about us here.How big will your impact be here?This is a unique opportunity to deliver data insights and impact across 10s, 100s and then 1000s of companies. Here‚Äôs some of what you will drive: Own insight models: Lead the development of human and actionable insight models. These models detect patterns, trends or correlations in our customer‚Äôs data. We use these findings to point the user in the right direction and guide them at every step of their data exploration journey thereafter (much like an in-house data team would).  Build an anomaly detection engine: It‚Äôs integral that the insights we provide customers are as accurate as possible. To achieve this, we need a way to quickly flag anomalies or discrepancies to users and to get them resolved seamlessly and accurately. These anomalies could include missing data, incorrect spelling, wrong tagging and other data quirks.  Work side-by-side with customers. You will be on the frontline with our early users (startup leaders) to understand their businesses and how we can iterate our insight models to best serve their needs.   Plan system expansion. Execute expansion as needed to support Calliper's growth and data science needs. Build out the roadmap on how the data stack evolves with the team. How can you grow in this role?A great Founding Data Scientist will be able to step up into a Team Lead role as the company scales. This means that you will have the opportunity to:Get more involved in hiring and building a world-class, global Data Science team Coach and mentor team members from many different backgrounds to grow in both their technical and leadership skills Enhance our data science capabilities by utilising the latest machine learning approaches and tooling Work on the longer-term strategic vision of Calliper, communicating with senior leadership, product management and operations RequirementsWhat are we looking for in you? Mission-driven. We are looking for missionaries, not mercenaries. Empowering teams with better data insights and enabling more cross-functional collaboration is something we are deeply passionate about  Excited by the culture we are building. Culture is very important to us, and we want you to be committed to working hard to help us create a long-lasting, high-performance culture  Data Science Degree? ML Bootcamp? Self Taught? Whatever... We aren‚Äôt precious about titles, and whilst a traditional statistics/data science background might be great, so will many others. The important thing is you love to ship high-quality data outputs fast and can‚Äôt live without getting user feedback‚Äç   Some startup experience. You should be aware of what you‚Äôre getting yourself in for with an early-stage company. Things can be intense and stressful and then thrilling and euphoric all in the same day, so you need to be ready for the emotional rollercoaster. Also, you are comfortable when faced with a lot of ambiguity, both technically and organisationally. You‚Äôre happy to tackle problems without a clear definition or solution What makes engineering at Calliper different? We‚Äôre creating a Data Analytics best practice. There are 100s of metrics which you can calculate to measure a business and each company today chooses its own subset and defines them in its own way. This breeds complexity and no way to disentangle signal from noise. We want to have customers narrow down to the handful of metrics and insights that really matter. Every function has gone through its own process of defining best practice: Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Software engineering, etc. so it‚Äôs natural that Data Practice follows the same steps.  Exciting data and machine learning challenges. As a data company, we‚Äôre always trying to push the quality bar and impact of the algorithms we develop for our customers. However, it‚Äôs not just about the quality of data science, we also work really hard to package them in sleek, interactive and low latency product experiences  Protected deep work sessions. Throughout the week we make time to shield the team from distractions and reactive work. Close Slack and turn off your notifications and ship some high-quality work  Strong advocation for great employee experience. We like using services that take care of undifferentiated work. Obviously, there are a handful of areas of the product where we need to build something custom ourselves, but in most cases, we are happy to pay for what‚Äôs already tried and tested  No BS. No ego. Just direct communication and an honest search for truth. We want to always be improving as a team and individuals, so we leave ego at the door and always try to be intellectually honest  Tight processes, clear goals and limited chaos. We are considerate and intentional with what we are building, so we always have a clear view of the roadmap and priorities. Startups are hard enough we don‚Äôt want to do crazy pivots every month  You can learn more about the wider company culture here.
