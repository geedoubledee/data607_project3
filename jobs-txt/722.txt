Participate and lead, multifaceted analytic studies on large volumes of data. Coordinate research and analytic activities utilizing various data points (unstructured and structured) and employ programming to clean, massage, and organize the data. Experiment against data points, provide insights based on experiment results and provide previously undiscovered solutions to command data challenges using a multitude of techniques e.g., exploratory mathematic and statistical techniques to NLP, vision, process mining, etc. Work with the Principal data scientist and participate in all the data experiments tasked by the Data Science Team. Analyze problems and determine root causes. Work closely with engineering teams to develop a strategy for long term data platform architecture. Be a hands-on practitioner (not just analyze but also actively contribute to the platform) RequirementsMaster's or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Process Mining, Statistics, Applied Math, Operational research, AI, or related field Overall 5+ years of experience. 3+ years' practical experience with data processing and analytics Experience and Understanding of Data quality, Features, Aspects of ML Models, ML pipeline/infrastructure. Able to understand various data structures and common methods in data transformation Excellent problem solving and debugging skills Excited to experiment with new technologies and approaches Experience in handling disparate data sources in a multitude of forms (e.g., event data, text, image, graphs, etc.) is desirable Experience in handling event streams and processing them Experience in building scalable solutions (optimizations) is desirable Added pluses: Experience/familiarity in process mining; experience/familiarity with OCR Fluency in Python
