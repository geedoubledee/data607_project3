Our promise to our associates is rock-solid: we grow together, we enjoy our work, and we inspire each other. Join in and feel the difference.The company' success lies in its highly specialized and innovative team, and on the technological know-how which makes Bosch the leading supplier in the automotive market.Bosch is becoming one of the world's leading companies in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT). At the Bosch Research & Development Center in Braga, more than 350 engineers develop car multimedia solutions and the most innovative localization, perception and safety sensors that are helping to shape connected and autonomous mobility. From hardware to software to physics, we have all kinds of opportunities waiting for you.Job DescriptionDeep Learning models have showed good performance when solving LiDAR based 3D tasks (e.g. object detection, semantic segmentation, lane, free space estimation, etc...). But deploying a model for each task is computationally expensive, especially when similar tasks, with similar modalities/information is being considered.This motivates the use of Multi-task networks which learn to simultaneously solve multiple related tasks.Your contribution to something big:- Create a multi-task deep learning model from LiDAR data to solve 3D tasks;
- Compare single tasks vs multitask performance;
- Investigate relation between number of tasks vs performance and complementary vs conflicting tasks;
- Explore possibility backbone/input-representation for all tasks;
- Compare with of multi-input representation model.QualificationsWhat distinguishes you: - Enrolled in a Masters program in Computer Science, Robotics, Physics, or a similar technical field of study;
- Solid C++ and/or Python programming skills;
- Experience in at least one of the following domains: machine learning, robotics, computer vision, LiDAR, Radar;
- Familiarity with deep learning frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow/PyTorch) is a plus;
- Good level of English (spoken and written);
- Sense of Team Work.Additional InformationWhat we offer you: Challenges in an international environment | career opportunities in one of the best companies in the world | flexible hours | medical services | discounts for employees | sports and health related activities | canteen | good access to public transports | space for creativity.Success stories don´t just happen. They are made... Make it happen. We are looking forward to your application!
