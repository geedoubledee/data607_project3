We encourage people of all backgrounds and identities to apply for this role, especially women and people of color; we strongly believe AI and robotics is our future, and teams built of a diverse range of people are necessary to bring us there.The Company:Tutor Intelligence is a startup in Boston’s Financial District building the technology and processes to let robots go where they’ve never gone before: the average American factory. We understand that general-purpose and generally-intelligent robots are going to be built in our lifetimes, and we’re combining human and artificial intelligence to lead the charge. As an AI software company who deploys its inventions directly into the facilities that need them, on state-of-the-art hardware, every line of code written at Tutor has a direct impact on the global, physical economy. We’re seeking the thinkers, builders, and researchers who can help us responsibly deliver the future of automation.The Role:In this role you will close the loop between human instruction and robot automation. Models you create will be deployed to robots out in the field, in a tight feedback loop controlled by you. You will create and improve deep learning models such as CNNs, build a cloud-based data and model training platform, and find ways to help our robots optimize for speed and accuracy.For this role, we seek a pragmatic and competent engineer with domain expertise in computer vision and robotics, and a drive to proliferate robotic technologies.At Tutor, engineering is inherently cross-disciplinary and collaborative. We seek someone with a diverse background across the robotics stack, including anything from full stack web-dev to mechanical engineering.Our Culture:We believe that something truly special can happen when talented, motivated people work together; at Tutor, every member of our team is empowered to have real impact in everything that they do. We’re characterized by both technical excellence and next-level collaboration and respect.
