About the team:
The Data Science team is responsible for deriving data-driven insights to support Worldcoin’s key decisions. Because of our unique growth model of using a global network of Orb Operators to give a free share of Worldcoin to everyone on Earth, we require a high-performing Data Science team that is able to manage and analyze large amounts of data generated by our products and operations. In particular, the team’s responsibilities include (1) business intelligence, (2) statistics, and (3) data engineering.

As our first Product Data Scientist, you will enable our Product team to make data-driven decisions regarding the design of the World App. You will be responsible for (1) optimizing the Product team’s data collection and experimentation efforts, (2) providing business intelligence insights, and (3) performing in-depth data analyses. You will report to our Head of Data Science, while being embedded in one or more product squads, working closely with our Head of Product and their team of senior product managers.

In this role, you will:
Help the product team collect the right data and define the right metrics to be able to measure and track the performance of the World App
Enable the product team to understand trends and patterns in a timely manner by building BI dashboards
Empower the product team with data and help them make decisions on the product roadmap (e.g., funnel metrics, analysis of churn)
Identify trends and connect sometimes seemingly disconnected data sets to develop hypotheses regarding key factors influencing the user lifecycle
Collaborate with our statistician to design and run experiments, ensuring  that the right approach is taken to disentangle causation from correlation
Develop both backwards-looking analyses on product performance and user behavior as well as forward-looking predictive models to help us better understand Worldcoin’s users and their needs (e.g., retention and engagement models, next-best action prediction)
Support and guide our early data infrastructure and tooling decisions
