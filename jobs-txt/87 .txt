If you have fallen and risen, if you have broken and fixed, if you have dreamt and built, then you have grit. Then we speak the same language. Welcome to the Wolfpack.About CloudWalk:We are one of the fastest growing fintechs on the planet. We kick ass. A unicorn, with millions of happy customers, a hardcore team, and hundreds of millions in funding and revenue. But not your typical startup.We build and learn, fast, and we want the hackers, the artists, the crafters - join the Wolfpack!Data without context is just a set of disconnected facts, meaningless points. To be useful, data needs to be converted into actionable knowledge. It needs to be intertwined into a bigger picture, associated with a hypothesis that needs to be solved. To do this we need an investigative sense, analytical experience and, above all, a curious mind.  CloudWalk wants to change how money is defined and used, and for that we need people that can navigate through uncharted waters of chaotic data. People that want to fight against this isomorphic world are all immersed into searching for new meanings, new possibilities. The AI team is responsible for research and development of new models and methods for usage in all areas of the company, like Risk, Marketing, Blockchain and others.
