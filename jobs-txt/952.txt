The current warehouse is architected primarily as a source data store and requires a lot of domain knowledge to extract maximum value out of the data.The adoption of our data warehouse is a key point to perform decision making in multiple different scenarios -- product A/B testing, operational efficiency, business efficiency, to name a few. With these use cases expanding across all organizations at Wolt, having a more ergonomic and less cumbersome data model becomes essential to support faster and safer data analysis.Together with your team you will be responsible for architecting, developing, managing and improving Wolt’s Data Warehouse Data Model, making sure it can be integrated with the workflow of our Analysts and the rest of the organization and our Data Engineering tools, ultimately becoming the one stop shop for sourcing data for all BI use cases and more.📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia.
