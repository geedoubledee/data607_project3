Supported the launch of several new methods of moving money in and out of our platform.

Day to day, you will:
Identify different areas of known and unknown risk and provide insights to reduce risk.
Analyze large amounts of device, user, and behavioral data to identify clusters of bad users.
Identify and create new risk signals to detect fraud.
Propose product solutions based on learnings from our data to add friction for fraudulent users without negatively impacting the product experience for good users.
Partner with Risk, Compliance, and Data Engineering to measure and consistently improve risk metrics.
Design and build tools for the Risk Operations team to automate processes and decision-making.
Research novel techniques and best practices to parse large, diverse data sets.
