Glacier builds in-house computer vision models to power our two core products: a robot that identifies and sorts commodities inside recycling facilities and an analytics system that tracks recyclables and reports metrics to key stakeholders in the industry. These technologies are already helping to divert tons of recyclables (literally!) from landfills every day. We’re looking for a talented machine learning engineer to help us further improve these game-changing technologies.


About us:

We’re a small team based in SF. Our founders come from Facebook engineering and Bain consulting. As an early member of our ML team, you’ll have a significant role in shaping Glacier’s future.
Commitment to ending waste and fighting climate change is in our team’s DNA. We are excited to bring on new teammates who share in this mission.
We’re backed by top-tier VCs and angels with extensive technical and industry expertise.
We have several machines in production at customer sites and a robust pipeline of upcoming deployments.

About the role:

We are looking for a talented machine learning engineer to help us build our game-changing technologies. You will be responsible for training computer vision models, building infrastructure for large-scale inference and data analysis, and driving new projects to use machine learning to reduce waste.


Your responsibilities:

Drive the performance of our computer vision models. That includes: building ML infrastructure, fine tuning our model and training process, improving our data collection, and ensuring high quality, diverse training data.
Build automation and experimentation into our full ML lifecycle, enabling us to deploy systems and create impact at scale.
Partner with our founders on the long-term product roadmap; we have lots of ideas for what waste-ending technology to build next, and we’d love to hear yours too!

Requirements:

(If you don't think you meet all of the criteria but are excited about us, please reach out anyway!)


2+ years experience developing machine learning models in a deep learning framework like Tensorflow/Keras or Pytorch.
Computer vision model development (especially object detectors) is strongly preferred.
Experience with building machine learning infrastructure (training pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, experiment tracking, etc).
Strong expertise in Python and hands-on experience in SQL databases.
Proficiency with the SciPy ecosystem (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and distributed computing in frameworks such as Ray.
Ability to work from our San Francisco office (SOMA neighborhood) on most days of the week.

The total cash compensation range for this role is $120,000 - $160,000. In addition to cash compensation, Glacier also offers competitive equity compensation and benefits. The final compensation for this role will depend on many individualized factors, including job-related skills and knowledge, experience level, interview performance, and other factors.

Senior, Staff or Principal Machine Learning Engineer


The EliseLabs organization within EliseAI is looking to hire for machine learning engineer roles at the senior, or above level. This position is available at both our New York office or Silicon Valley, for hybrid or in-person work.


EliseLabs builds a powerful natural language development platform that facilitates automated, human quality conversational experiences. Today, our platform hosts the leading AI leasing assistant in the prop-tech space, serving over 100 of the top multifamily property management companies. It is our mission to make the same technology accessible across domains and industries.


To build these products, the following are some of the modules you will help design and maintain: our core conversational library (think Pandas for conversations), our dynamic graph database to representing all data, our efficient query language for deeply nested objects, an execution service to register and run user-defined classes and functions (think MLFlow but more generic), computer vision, audio and natural language machine learning models, deployment server and infrastructure, and many more.


You will have direct impact on a product that serves tens of thousands of conversations daily in one domain today, and you will help scale the platform to serve millions of conversations daily across the first one hundred domains.


Responsibilities:

Design, build and scale entire components of the platform
Collaborate closely with product and machine learning engineers to deliver a data centric AI platform
Learn and drive engineering best practices. We build software for developers

Qualifications:

Thrives taking on impossible problems; you will be part of a product that revolutionizes the state of conversational AI
Is driven and excited to join a highly productive team composed of engineers and scientists at a fast-growing startup
Has strong programming and system design skills
Experience with large generative language models
Comfortable with standard deep learning libraries, like Hugging Face, Torch, deployment tools

Example projects:

build SOTA NLP inference and language generation models
build large distributed machine learning infrastructure
develop machine learning driven data processing engines

Nice to haves include:

Experience with C
Compiler experience
Has strong fundamentals in machine learning and statistics evidenced by a track record of independent quantitative research (academic or industry) or projects
PHD in quantitative discipline such as computer science, physics, or similar

As part of EliseAI, the Labs team is well-resourced, but operates largely independently from the prop-tech focused organization. This allows us to take the risks and enables high rewards in a fast-paced development environment. Rather than iterating, we build paradigm shifting tools that unlock 10x improvements over existing technologies.


EliseLabs actively develops three product categories:

Standalone APIs serving individual components for the conversational AI lifecycle: data exploration, human labeling, model training, deployment and inference
A platform providing an integrated development environment to create automated conversational agents
Conversations as a service, a concierge service to implement automated or partially automated conversations for our enterprise client with custom integrations

Why join

Growth and impact. It’s not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded startup that’s scaling. That means that instead of following a playbook, you’ll be writing it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You’ll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn’t when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.


Compensation & Benefits

In addition to the growth and impact you’ll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:

Top of personal market compensation (base salary range is between $225,000 and $380,000, flexibility for uniquely qualified candidates)

We’re looking for an experienced and insightful ML practitioner who believes that the answer isn’t always just more data, and who has a deep appreciation of the benefits of sparsity, hierarchy, and the mixture-of-experts approach. With theoretical and practical assistance from your team, you’ll help architect solutions to some of the most fundamental problems in machine comprehension, and some of the biggest challenges to the defense industry. You’ll have substantial opportunity for project management and ownership. You’ll work with our contracts team to scope written proposals and project solutions. You’ll work with our R&D platform engineers to help them make their product useful for you and Modern’s scientists. If desired, you’ll have the opportunity to propose new theoretical innovations, and to design experiments to test and refine these innovations. As an early hire, you’ll have the opportunity and active encouragement to grow into leadership and supervisory roles as the company expands.

Qualifications

MS or equivalent experience in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or related field. PhD or equivalent experience preferred. Candidates still in their graduate program will be considered
