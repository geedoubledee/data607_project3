"In 2013, we at Fantasy Football Analytics released web apps to help people make better decisions in fantasy football based on the wisdom of the crowd. Over the past six years, the community response has been incredibly supportive, and we continually improved the apps in response to user feedback. The community also contributed directly to the project, with a number of users making additions and edits to our public source R scripts on our GitHub repo and our ffanalytics R package. In sum, we provide web apps built by the people, for the people.","207","3"
"This brings me to our call for help. A key member of our team is stepping down at the end of the season.

"EMC Research Inc –  Seeking developer experienced with publishing and maintaining R packages","220","3"
"EMC Research is a full-service market research and analytics firm in business since 1989 with offices in Seattle, Oakland, Portland, Columbus, and Washington DC. We are looking to hire a developer to write an R package that will allow us to continue to produce our core crosstab deliverable. EMC Research currently uses SPSS 20 on our local workstations, primarily for survey data cleaning, analysis and creating deliverable-quality crosstabulations. In our existing configuration, we rely on SPSS Python Essentials and a custom Python (version 2.7) site package in order to transform SPSS output and generate our crosstab deliverables. Our users also use R and the RStudio IDE to weight survey data and other ad hoc analyses. With this new R package, we plan on replacing SPSS and Python completely and moving all cleaning, analysis and needed deliverable preparation to R. Note, the package we have found that can produce an output that most closely resembles our current deliverable is tableone (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableone/vignettes/introduction.html), but it is not adaptable enough for our purposes.","220","4"

"Since it was set up in 2012 with the mission to align financial markets with climate goals, the 2° Investing Initiative (2°ii) has become a pioneering think tank – with offices in Berlin, Paris, London and New York – on the integration of long-term risks and policy objectives into financial markets and regulatory frameworks. 2°ii developed the first scenario analysis tool linking financial portfolios to public policy objectives – specifically the 2°C climate goal – which is now applied to over $10 trillion assets under management across more than 1,000 financial institutions, as well as a number of financial supervisors. 2°ii co-designed the first climate-related financial regulation in the world (Art. 173 of the French Energy Transition Law).  A core principle of its mission is to reduce the transaction costs across companies, financial institutions and policymakers, while guiding financial markets towards the long-term future.","234","5"
"Current research includes development of climate alignment tools for banks, market outlook reports and enhancement of existing, analytical methods as well as a sustainability-ready, open-source robo-adviser. 2°ii has a multi-stakeholder and independent governance framework designed to ensure the intellectual integrity of its work and its independence.

Our team of Shippians comprises 28 different nationalities, speaking a total of 24 languages. Job DescriptionWe are looking for an Intern in Data Science to join our Data & AI/ML tribe.The Data & AI/ML tribe is responsible for leveraging the large amount of data that Shippeo has been acquiring over the course of running the platform and rolling it out to multiple shippers and carriers, to get insights from it.One of the main features the team builds and improves is Shippeo’s proprietary Machine algorithm that predicts Estimated Times of Arrival (ETA) of vessels, which is an extremely difficult exercise due to all the uncertainties in ocean transportation (weather conditions, port congestion, time spent on ports to load and discharge merchandises, ...). We are constantly looking for new ways to make the ETA prediction as accurate and reliable as possible, to help our users anticipate delays. In the Shippeo platform, Ocean ETA is mainly used to answer the following customer needs:1. When exactly will a vessel arrive at a given port and when will this vessel be able to discharge its containers?2. Is there a risk of delay at any of these milestones? In this context, we would like to focus on port congestion problematic and better understand: : What can cause this congestion : Can we predict it using vessel operations inside the ports ? Is there a form of seasonality? … What are its effects at vessel level : Are all vessels affected by port congestion in the same way ? In the case of a congested port, are the first in the first out?  This internship will consist in exploring and proposing different strategies to improve our ML models performance. This will for instance involve : Training of a classification model to predict whether a vessel will be anchored at its arrival at the destination port using data related to port congestion Training of a regression model to predict the duration of this anchorage in the event that it occurs Dashboards to visualize ports congestion at the moment and also what we predict will happenQualificationsYou are pursuing a MSc degree (or equivalent) with a major in Data Science, and are in your final year Knowledge and experience with relational databases (SQL, data modeling)Strong analytical skills with the ability to collect, organize, analyze, and disseminate significant amounts of information with attention to detail and accuracyProgramming skills in Python and experience with scientific programming libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy)Additional InformationRecruitment Process : Preliminary callTechnical interview and final interview","417","2"

"About CalliperAt Calliper, we believe that data should be for the many, not the few. Data is one of the most valuable assets companies have. Yet, most struggle to unlock its potential. We're here to change that.We help companies win by making better decisions with data, faster. Calliper is a mission control centre for the whole company - making data accessible and actionable for everyone.Aggregate fragmented sources. Remove noise. Align teams.This is Collaborative Analytics.We're a fast-growing startup backed by Sequoia and 35+ operator angels and late-stage startup founders who have first-hand experienced the challenges of building data-driven organisations. See a short demo of what we are building here.As a company, we deeply care about our people and the culture we’re building. Learn more about us here.How big will your impact be here?This is a unique opportunity to deliver data insights and impact across 10s, 100s and then 1000s of companies. Here’s some of what you will drive: Own insight models: Lead the development of human and actionable insight models. These models detect patterns, trends or correlations in our customer’s data. We use these findings to point the user in the right direction and guide them at every step of their data exploration journey thereafter (much like an in-house data team would).  Build an anomaly detection engine: It’s integral that the insights we provide customers are as accurate as possible. To achieve this, we need a way to quickly flag anomalies or discrepancies to users and to get them resolved seamlessly and accurately. These anomalies could include missing data, incorrect spelling, wrong tagging and other data quirks.  Work side-by-side with customers. You will be on the frontline with our early users (startup leaders) to understand their businesses and how we can iterate our insight models to best serve their needs.   Plan system expansion. Execute expansion as needed to support Calliper's growth and data science needs. Build out the roadmap on how the data stack evolves with the team. How can you grow in this role?A great Founding Data Scientist will be able to step up into a Team Lead role as the company scales. This means that you will have the opportunity to:Get more involved in hiring and building a world-class, global Data Science team Coach and mentor team members from many different backgrounds to grow in both their technical and leadership skills Enhance our data science capabilities by utilising the latest machine learning approaches and tooling Work on the longer-term strategic vision of Calliper, communicating with senior leadership, product management and operations RequirementsWhat are we looking for in you? Mission-driven. We are looking for missionaries, not mercenaries. Empowering teams with better data insights and enabling more cross-functional collaboration is something we are deeply passionate about  Excited by the culture we are building. Culture is very important to us, and we want you to be committed to working hard to help us create a long-lasting, high-performance culture  Data Science Degree? ML Bootcamp? Self Taught? Whatever... We aren’t precious about titles, and whilst a traditional statistics/data science background might be great, so will many others. The important thing is you love to ship high-quality data outputs fast and can’t live without getting user feedback‍   Some startup experience. You should be aware of what you’re getting yourself in for with an early-stage company. Things can be intense and stressful and then thrilling and euphoric all in the same day, so you need to be ready for the emotional rollercoaster. Also, you are comfortable when faced with a lot of ambiguity, both technically and organisationally. You’re happy to tackle problems without a clear definition or solution What makes engineering at Calliper different? We’re creating a Data Analytics best practice. There are 100s of metrics which you can calculate to measure a business and each company today chooses its own subset and defines them in its own way. This breeds complexity and no way to disentangle signal from noise. We want to have customers narrow down to the handful of metrics and insights that really matter. Every function has gone through its own process of defining best practice: Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Software engineering, etc. so it’s natural that Data Practice follows the same steps.  Exciting data and machine learning challenges. As a data company, we’re always trying to push the quality bar and impact of the algorithms we develop for our customers. However, it’s not just about the quality of data science, we also work really hard to package them in sleek, interactive and low latency product experiences  Protected deep work sessions. Throughout the week we make time to shield the team from distractions and reactive work. Close Slack and turn off your notifications and ship some high-quality work  Strong advocation for great employee experience. We like using services that take care of undifferentiated work. Obviously, there are a handful of areas of the product where we need to build something custom ourselves, but in most cases, we are happy to pay for what’s already tried and tested  No BS. No ego. Just direct communication and an honest search for truth. We want to always be improving as a team and individuals, so we leave ego at the door and always try to be intellectually honest  Tight processes, clear goals and limited chaos. We are considerate and intentional with what we are building, so we always have a clear view of the roadmap and priorities. Startups are hard enough we don’t want to do crazy pivots every month  You can learn more about the wider company culture here.  What is the stack you will start with?We have made some intentional technical choices but we're still early in our journey so there is plenty of room to contribute to our roadmap. Currently, we are working with the following technologies:Pandas, numpy, SQL for data transformations Python3 with type hints Snowflake as a data warehouse Fivetran for data ingestion Postgres as a hot data storage Prefect for running jobs What are Calliper's values?We strive to be thoughtful and intentional with the culture we build at Calliper.🏆 Take ownership, deliver work you’re proud of. Having high personal standards and delivering quality work is very important to us. We care about the details. ⛩  Choose simplicity, bring order to the chaos. Less is more, don’t try to overcomplicate things and always find out how things can be reduced to their core. 📣  Create transparency, communicate proactively and authentically.
